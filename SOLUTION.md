## B. Working With Brane

### Beginning
In our experience, Brane had quite a steep learning curve. Towards the beginning, we struggled with understanding how the framework actually used the different nodes to run things. Fortunately we then found out that they are not necessarily needed, and decided to stick to local running. 

### Code and YML
After being able to run the example code, we started to work on the actual task. The main issues here were understanding the way Brane worked with outputs. It was really confusing that printing was processed in a different way than returning, but this can also be attributed to the fact that we ran through the documentation quite quickly.

### BraneScript
BraneScript was really nice to use, especially in the repl for quick testing. The only issues we had with it were not being able to use the repl for the actual task due to the inability to use the `commit_result` function. Also, we found out that reusing the same variable cannot be done, a feature that would be really nice to have.

### Brane Datatypes
Using the datatypes inside of Brane was slightly confusing when we had to go into more specific stuff (arrays). We had an intense session of understanding how Rust variables are defined in order to get the arrays to work. After running out of sources on this without being able to get it to work, we had a dive into the Brane source code to find out how it was done there. Although it was very interesting to see how the Brane team had done it, it was a bit time consuming due to the lack of documentation on this.

### Our Conclusions
Overall, we found Brane to be a very interesting framework to work with. It was a bit confusing at times, but we were able to get it to work in the end. Despite the extra overhead that docker creates for testing the code, the actual code running is very fast which was super nice. The repl is a superb addition to the framework, and we really enjoyed using it.
